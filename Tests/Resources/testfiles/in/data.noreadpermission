Surprised you can read this? You can, because the file needs read permission so
that it can be copied to (or retrieved from) a repository.

When it's being used in a unit test case, the test function first removes the
file's read permission, then performs the test, and finally restores the
original permissions.

So please don't remove the read permissions yourself. If you do that, then when
the test function restores the "original permissions", it will be restoring
no-read permissions, and repository commits (and possibly other actions) will
fail mysteriously.

And thanks for reading!
